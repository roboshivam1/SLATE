"""Core data model.

The load-bearing idea is the split between spec and state:

  Spec objects (BeatSpec, VideoSpec) are the declarative description of a
  video. They are frozen, fully serialisable, and they are the ONLY thing that
  feeds a cache key.

  State objects (Beat, Video) wrap a spec and carry the artifacts that pipeline
  stages produce. They are mutable and are never hashed.
