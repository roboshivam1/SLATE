"""ChalkdustScene: the base every component renders into.

Two jobs:

  1. Apply the theme (background colour, resolved fonts).
  2. Run layout assertions at settle points -- the moments when animation has
     stopped and the frame should be inspectable. This is where layout bugs
     get caught, at build time, before a frame is ever rendered.

A component that never calls settle() is a component whose layout is never
checked, so `construct` runs a final settle unconditionally.
